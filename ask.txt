Have a think about a salary etc - "compensation" as they say - what sorts of things are you going to be thinking about? The thing is, I helped shoehorn Ash into the big time and Chris walked away with the money .... I know you guys can't really pay top whack for the job you need (jobserve has similar roles at 70-100k), but I don't really want to earn not-so-much and then watch you guys pocket your 8 million each and leave me with 20p and a cheese sandwich.
